<span></span></button>
                <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet connection by routing it through a secure remote server, masking your IP address and creating an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet. This enhances privacy by hiding your traffic from ISPs, advertisers, and hackers
</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2', this)"> Are VPNs safe?
<span></span></button>
                <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">VPNs are generally safe and legal—provided you choose a reputable provider that offers strong encryption, a transparent no‑logs policy, and reliable privacy features. Free VPNs often limit privacy and may monetize user data.

</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq3', this)">Do VPNs slow down your internet?
 <span></span></button>
                <div id="faq3" class="faq-content">Yes, using a VPN can slightly reduce your internet speed. This slowdown is due to the extra steps of encrypting your data and routing it through a remote server. However, most modern VPNs minimize this impact to a level barely noticeable for general use .
